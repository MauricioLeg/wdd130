                <h2>History</h2>
                <p><strong>XLR8 Company — A brief story </strong>
                    XLR8 Company began when three college friends returned to their mountain town with one shared impulse: get people 
                    into the river and out of their screens. They bought a battered raft, painted a lightning bolt across its prow, and 
                    ran their first trip for seven nervous strangers who left the canyon hoarse with laughter and oddly calmer than when they 
                    arrived. Word spread not through flashy ads but through stories: a junior high class who learned teamwork on the first 
                    rapid, a couple who decided to get married on the riverbank, an office team who found new trust after the first drop.
                </p>

                <p>  XLR8 grew by honing two things—raw, honest adventure and careful stewardship of the river—so every guest left with a 
                    story and every season left the canyon cleaner than it had been.
                    Now a small fleet and a crew of local guides steer XLR8’s signature runs, where guides call commands like music and 
                    strangers become a crew. Their promise is simple: fast enough to feel alive, safe enough to come back, and wild enough to 
                    change you.</p>
